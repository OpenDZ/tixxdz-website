            Past week Wiz blogged about Overlayfs bugs that can be abused on Ubuntu Kernels to perform privilege escalation, named GameOver(lay) read more here.
Those are CVE-2023-2640 and CVE-2023-32629, also Datadog has another writeup about a previous Overlayfs upstream vulnerability CVE-2023-0386.
 Background  All these are mostly the same: Overlayfs can be mounted inside a user namespace, but the security checks and value validation when copying up files and their metadata from the lower to the upper layer inside the user namespace were not sufficient.

      <title>Kernel Image Lockdown and eBPF Flexibility!</title>

            The Kernel Lockdown feature that was merged in Linux 5.4 is designed to prevent both direct and indirect access to a running kernel image, attempting to protect against unauthorized modification of the kernel image and to prevent access to security and cryptographic data located in kernel memory, whilst still permitting driver modules to be loaded.
 Introduction  In his post Linux kernel lockdown, integrity, and confidentiality Matthew Garrett first explains that it took around 7 years journey to get the lockdown patches merged!

      <title>eBPF: Block Linux Fileless Payload &#34;Malware&#34; Execution with BPF LSM</title>

            Due to the security features that Linux offers, like booting directly into a readonly filesystem, making filesystems readonly at runtime for apps and containers, some attacks have been using what is known as &amp;quot;fileless binary execution&amp;quot; to avoid such protections, and gain the ability to execute binaries directly from the memory without touching or leaving traces on the disk.
From Wikipedia &amp;quot;Fileless malware is a variant of computer related malicious software that exists exclusively as a computer memory-based artifact i.

      <title>Modernization of Linux proc filesystem and containers security</title>
      <link>https://djalal.opendz.org/post/linux-kernel-private-proc-instances-per-pidns/</link>

      <description>
        
          
            TL;DR: The Linux kernel procfs suffers from a historical design that prevents having multiple separate procfs instances inside the same PID namespace. All the mounts are a mirror of the internal one. This blocks developement of Linux containers, sandboxes, and other security related features.
Patch solution: PATCH RFC v3 proc: modernize proc to support multiple private instances
Problem Linux containers and other sandbox mechanisms want to hide processes, files and directories of procfs, other implementations want to restrict some procfs features.

      <title>Linux kernel improve Module autoloading infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://djalal.opendz.org/post/linux-kernel-improve-module-autoloading-infrastructure/</link>

      <description>
        
          
            TL;DR: Currently, an explicit call to load or unload kernel modules require CAP_SYS_MODULE capability. However unprivileged users have always been able to load some modules using the implicit auto-load operation. An automatic module loading happens when programs request a kernel feature from a module that is not loaded. In order to satisfy userspace, the kernel then automatically load all these required modules, however attackers have been abusing this functionality to load vulnerable modules.

            &lt;p&gt;TL;DR: In Linux kernel and as part of the Kernel Self Protection Project we are pushing for new lightweight security mechanisms. On top of that, in systemd we are implementing new lightweight container mechanisms that target Embedded Linux and IoT. Our goal is to make it easy to deploy Secure Embedded Linux and IoT systems.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>systemd Sandbox or systemd Lightweight Containers</title>

            Sandboxing IoT Apps using lightweight containers is an important step for Linux-IoT based devices, it allows to reduce the exposure from mis-configuration, bugs, or vulnerability exploitation.
 As a simple example the BrickerBot and similar worms did not use complex 0day exploits. They used simple attack vectors like unprotected remote shells accounts and according to internet resources, lot of IoT devices were affected. The straightforward solution in this case should be a firewall solution plus a powerful sandbox mechanism for apps.

      <title>Linux kernel - /proc/pid/environ fixes</title>
      <link>https://djalal.opendz.org/post/linux-kernel-proc-pid-envrion-fixes/</link>

      <description>
        
          
            Just to share that Linux /proc/pid/environ suffers from bugs referenced and fixed here: proc: /proc//environ offset fixes that can be considered vulnerabilities.
The fixes are in the mainline now. The PoC to dump exec area can found here: http://lkml.org/lkml/2012/7/22/163
Linux Procfs suffers from other vulnerabilities, like the:
 -open() + -dup(stdin,stdoutâ¦) + execve(suid_program)â¦  These were discussed several times on lkml. If you want a quick nice fix, that only compares u64bit values, check the recent Grsecurity patches.
