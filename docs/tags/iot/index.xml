            Due to the security features that Linux offers, like booting directly into a readonly filesystem, making filesystems readonly at runtime for apps and containers, some attacks have been using what is known as &amp;quot;fileless binary execution&amp;quot; to avoid such protections, and gain the ability to execute binaries directly from the memory without touching or leaving traces on the disk.
 From Wikipedia &amp;quot;Fileless malware is a variant of computer related malicious software that exists exclusively as a computer memory-based artifact i.

            &lt;p&gt;TL;DR: In Linux kernel and as part of the Kernel Self Protection Project we are pushing for new lightweight security mechanisms. On top of that, in systemd we are implementing new lightweight container mechanisms that target Embedded Linux and IoT. Our goal is to make it easy to deploy Secure Embedded Linux and IoT systems.&lt;/p&gt;
